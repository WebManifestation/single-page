        Amano Takashi, the founder of Nature Aquarium. His career encompasses a
        wide range of activities as an aquascape creator, the CEO of Aqua Design
        Amano Co., Ltd. and an ecology & landscape photographer., born in
        Niigata, Japan in 1954. Since 1975, Amano has visited tropical
        rainforests in Amazon, Borneo and West Africa and pristine forests in
        Japan, and he worked on a series of photos focusing on "untouched
        nature" with his large-format cameras. He captures minute details of
        nature found at site on extra large size films (up to 8x20 inches). His
        works have been made famous internationally through several exhibitions
        and publications.

            Planted aquariums and landscape photographs are seemingly not
            related. But in Amano’s mind, they are closely linked with each
            other as a seamless process of creative activity. Nature Aquarium is
            absolutely not created from nothing. As suggested by its concept
            “Learn from Nature”, Nature Aquarium is an approach for planted
            aquarium layout which could not be achieved without the existence of
            nature.

        Amano said he accumulates countless images of nature in his mind by
        taking numerous number of landscape photographs. These images will be
        reflected in the creation of Nature Aquarium layouts. This is why a
        Nature Aquarium is crucially different from other planted aquarium
        layout techniques.

        Nature Aquarium recreates an ecosystem that is found in nature by
        growing aquatic plants to make a favorable environment within an
        aquarium tank and keeping animals such as fish and shrimp together with
        plants. It is a unique world created by the marriage of beauty of nature
        and a harmonious environment. A beautiful aquascape where healthy grown
        aquatic plants thrive and colorful tropical fish swim soothes our mind.

            Takashi Amano pioneered the concept of introducing Carbon di-oxide
            (CO2) into aquariums. Injecting CO2 into an aquarium made it
            possible to grow heliophytic aquatic plants in an aquarium, which
            was so difficult to do until then.The appearance of some plants
            adorned with air bubbles formed from healthy photosynthesis
            captivated many people.

            The Iwagumi layout is one of the most challenging aquascaping styles
            out there. Developed around 30 years ago by Takashi Amano, this type
            of aquascape represents not just a minimalist layout, it also
            reflects the Japanese culture, spirituality and love for beauty and
            simplicity.

            Building Iwagumi layout without any hesitation in a short time can
            be said to be the essence of giving momentum (= power) to Iwagumi,
            but in order to do so, a wealth of experience is indispensable. To
            master the Iwagumi, it seems that you have to observe as many stones
            as possible in nature and create as many Iwagumi layouts as
            possible.
